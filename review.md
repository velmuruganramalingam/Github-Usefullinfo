# Review feedback

Example
Being one of the most consistent, trusted and passionate contributor - //Associate// has shown an exceptional achievement in his growth path by demonstrating high degree of maturity and collaboration  in the last year. He is widely trusted and respected by others and truly a champion of supporting the overall performance of the team and organization  Aditya has played a very pivotal role in strengthening the confidence and trust of the broader team. Added to that, he often has contributed in a number of cross team and cross functional activities with equal competence & zeal.

//Associate// displayed high dedication along with his solid technical capabilities throughout the year but he can really outclass himself with a little more organized approach to sharpen his technical excellence. Instead of hunting around he should be more focus in identifying his core strengths and start focusing to implement them objectively. He needs to hold his nerve and show more equanimity for project metrics (scope, schedule, cost and quality) and status reporting.  

Though the majority of the assignments that he has undertaken have been accomplished on the high, yet there are certain areas where a critical self-retrospective might turn him into a more composed, reliable and prudent leader

### Communication
With a brilliant verbal and written communication, Aditya needs to have more control on his project communication.  He needs to understand that communication is a two way channel and often leads to unaccountable ambiguity if it is not catered properly.
### Process Adherence
//Associate// needs to be more careful for process adherence and learn to demonstrate a positive disposition toward the task. He should respect that processes are made to define the roadmap and not to restrict the flamboyancy of individuals.
### Mentoring
He needs to remember that he is a “Model” for many junior developers and hence he should more judgmental and pragmatic in mentoring them effectively for the process. A true reflection of this activity could be how he is driving the team to get more involved in various automation / research oriented initiatives and adding better value propositions to the entire solution.
